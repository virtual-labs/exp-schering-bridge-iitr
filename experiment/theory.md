### Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Schering Bridge is a bridge circuit used for measuring an unknown electrical capacitance and its dissipation factor. The dissipation factor of a capacitor is the the ratio of its resistance to its capacitive reactance. The Schering Bridge is basically a four-arm alternating-current (AC) bridge circuit whose measurement depends on balancing the loads on its arms Figure 1 below shows a diagram of the Schering Bridge.<br><br>

### Explanation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Schering Bridge above, the resistance values of resistors R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are known, while the resistance value of resistor R<sub>3</sub> is unknown. The capacitance values of C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> are also known, while the capacitance of C<sub>3</sub> is the value being measured. To measure R<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>, the values of C<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are fixed, while the values of R<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>1</sub> are adjusted until the current through the ammeter between points A and B becomes zero. This happens when the voltages at points A and B are equal, in which case the bridge is said to be 'balanced'.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bridge is balanced, Z<sub>1</sub>/C<sub>2</sub> = R<sub>2</sub>/Z<sub>3</sub>, where Z<sub>1</sub> is the impedance of R<sub>1</sub> in parallel with C<sub>1</sub> and Z<sub>3</sub> is the impedance of R<sub>3</sub> in series with C<sub>3</sub>. In an AC circuit that has a capacitor, the capacitor contributes a capacitive reactance to the impedance. When the bridge is balanced, the negative and positive reactive components are equal and cancel out, so

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, when the bridge is balanced, the purely resistive components are equal, so C<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>3</sub> = R<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1</sub> or C<sub>3</sub> = R<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub> / R<sub>2</sub>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the balancing of a Schering Bridge is independent of frequency.


### Advantages:
* Balance equation is independent of frequency.
* Used for measuring the insulating properties of electrical cables and equipmentâ€™s.
